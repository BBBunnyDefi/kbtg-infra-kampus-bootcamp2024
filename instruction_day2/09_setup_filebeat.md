# 09_setup_filebeat
You deploy Filebeat as a DaemonSet to ensure thereâ€™s a running instance on each node of the cluster.

The container logs host folder (/var/log/containers) is mounted on the Filebeat container. Filebeat starts an input for the files and begins harvesting them as soon as they appear in the folder.

Everything is deployed under the infra-logging namespace.
